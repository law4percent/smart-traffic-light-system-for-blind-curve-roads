# smart-traffic-light-system-for-blind-curves
The Smart Traffic Light System is designed to enhance traffic management on curved roads, where blind spots often occur. The system uses a centrally positioned camera to monitor both the left and right sides of the road. Two traffic lights are installed â€” one on the left side and one on the right side of the road.
